The project proposes a model-driven approach to manage the development of service choreographies, from specification  downto implementation. For each participant service, a coordination delegate abstracts that portion of the choreography behavior, which concerns the interaction of the service. Then, to suitably coordinate the discovered services, hence realizing the specified choreography, specific architectural constraints are imposed on the choreography-based system to be built. Such constraints are encoded into suitable Model Transformations. They are used to automatically generate the actual code of the coordination delegates that, once assembled with the discovered services, realizes the specified choreography.
